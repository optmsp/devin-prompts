# React Documentation Process Overview

This guide provides developers with a high-level overview of the phased approach to documenting React code. It outlines the process that will occur when using Devin to document your React codebase. The documentation process is divided into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview

The documentation process is broken down into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Component Documentation**
   - Focus on component-level documentation
   - Document overall purpose and responsibilities
   - Refer to `react-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for implementation

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document component methods and handlers
   - Include parameter and return types
   - Refer to `react-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for implementation

3. **Phase 3: Props and Hooks Documentation**
   - Document component props and hooks
   - Include type information and constraints
   - Refer to `react-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for implementation

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target React project folder
- Knowledge of React documentation standards (refer to "React Code Documentation KB")
- React Developer Tools for component inspection (if available)
- TypeScript/PropTypes configuration (if used)

### Process Flow
1. Copy the Phase 1 playbook (`react-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md`) to Devin
2. Devin will document components and request your approval
3. Copy the Phase 2 playbook (`react-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md`) to Devin
4. Devin will document methods and request your approval
5. Copy the Phase 3 playbook (`react-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md`) to Devin
6. Devin will document props/hooks and request your final approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before proceeding to the next
- Devin will follow the React Code Documentation KB guidelines
- Devin will use TypeScript/PropTypes for type validation when available
- Documentation will focus on clarity and maintainability

### Implementation Steps
To begin documentation with Devin, copy and paste the following playbooks in sequence:
1. Phase 1 (Components): Copy `react-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` to Devin
2. Phase 2 (Methods): Copy `react-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` to Devin after Phase 1 approval
3. Phase 3 (Props/Hooks): Copy `react-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` to Devin after Phase 2 approval
