Hi Devin! This playbook will guide you through documenting React code using a phased approach. The documentation process is split into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview
The documentation process is divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Component Documentation**
   - Focus on high-level component descriptions and responsibilities
   - Document overall purpose and role in the system
   - See: `react-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document component methods and event handlers
   - Include parameter types and return values
   - See: `react-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Phase 3: Props and Hooks Documentation**
   - Document component props and their constraints
   - Document custom hooks and their usage
   - Include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
   - See: `react-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target React project folder
- Knowledge of React documentation standards (refer to "React Code Documentation KB")
- React Developer Tools for component inspection (if available)
- ESLint with React plugin for validation

### Process Flow
1. Start with Phase 1 (Components)
2. Get approval after completing Phase 1
3. Move to Phase 2 (Methods)
4. Get approval after completing Phase 2
5. Complete Phase 3 (Props/Hooks)
6. Final review and approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before moving to the next
- Follow the detailed instructions in the phase-specific playbooks
- Refer to the React Documentation KB for standards and best practices
- Use ESLint and React Developer Tools for validation
- Focus on clarity and maintainability
- Include JSDoc-style documentation with @component tags
- Consider TypeScript type definitions where applicable
