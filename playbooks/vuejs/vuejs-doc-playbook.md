Hi Devin! This playbook will guide you through documenting Vue.js code using a phased approach. The documentation process is split into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview
The documentation process is divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Component Documentation**
   - Focus on high-level component descriptions and responsibilities
   - Document overall purpose and role in the system
   - See: `vuejs-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document component methods and lifecycle hooks
   - Include parameter types and return values
   - See: `vuejs-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Phase 3: Props and Events Documentation**
   - Document component props and their validation rules
   - Document emitted events and their payloads
   - Include slots and provide/inject relationships
   - See: `vuejs-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target Vue.js project folder
- Knowledge of Vue.js documentation standards (refer to "Vue.js Code Documentation KB")
- Vue.js DevTools for component inspection (if available)
- ESLint with Vue.js plugin for validation

### Process Flow
1. Start with Phase 1 (Components)
2. Get approval after completing Phase 1
3. Move to Phase 2 (Methods)
4. Get approval after completing Phase 2
5. Complete Phase 3 (Props/Events)
6. Final review and approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before moving to the next
- Follow the detailed instructions in the phase-specific playbooks
- Refer to the Vue.js Documentation KB for standards and best practices
- Use ESLint and Vue.js DevTools for validation
- Focus on clarity and maintainability
- Include JSDoc-style documentation in script sections
- Consider TypeScript type definitions where applicable
- Document template slots and scoped slots appropriately
