Hi Devin! This playbook will guide you through Phase 1 of documenting Vue.js code, focusing specifically on component-level documentation. This is part of a phased approach where we'll document components first, then methods, and finally props and events.

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target Vue.js project folder
- Knowledge of Vue.js documentation standards (refer to "Vue.js Code Documentation KB" in your knowledge base)
- Vue.js DevTools for component inspection (if available)

### Phase 1: Component Documentation Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # List all Vue component files
   find /path/to/folder -name "*.vue" -type f
   ```

2. **Component Inventory**
   - Create a list of all components needing documentation
   - For each component:
     ```vue
     <!-- Example component documentation -->
     <template>
       <!-- Component template -->
     </template>

     <script>
     /**
      * User profile card component
      *
      * Displays user information in a card format with customizable
      * slots for header and footer content.
      */
     export default {
       name: 'UserProfileCard',
     }
     </script>
     ```

3. **Component Documentation Process**
   For each component:

   ```vue
   /**
    * [Brief component description]
    *
    * [Detailed explanation of component purpose and functionality]
    * Focus on the component's overall responsibility and role in the system.
    * Describe what problem it solves and how it fits into the application.
    * Do not document props, events, or methods in this phase.
    */
   ```

   Note: Props, events, and methods documentation will be handled in Phase 2 and Phase 3 respectively.

4. **Phase 1 Documentation Checklist**
   For each component:
   - [ ] Component has clear, concise description
   - [ ] Component's purpose and responsibility is well documented
   - [ ] Documentation follows no-prefix rule (avoid "Description:" or "Summary:")
   - [ ] Documentation is focused on component-level concerns only
   - [ ] Documentation explains component's role in the application
   - [ ] Documentation is clear and helpful for new developers

5. **Validation Steps**
   - Test documentation in IDE
   - Verify prop validation works
   - Check event documentation accuracy
   - Review with component examples

6. **Final Review**
   - Ensure all components are documented
   - Verify documentation matches implementation
   - Check for missing prop/event documentation
   - Confirm documentation helps new developers

### Example Phase 1 Documentation

Here's an example of well-documented component-level documentation:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="user-card">
    <!-- Template implementation will be documented in later phases -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
/**
 * User Card Component
 *
 * A reusable card component for displaying user information with a 
 * consistent layout across the application. This component serves as
 * the primary user interface element for showing user details in lists,
 * grids, and individual profile views.
 *
 * The component is designed to be flexible and maintainable, supporting
 * various display modes and customization options through its API.
 * It integrates with the application's design system and follows
 * accessibility best practices.
 */
export default {
  name: 'UserCard'
  // Props, methods, and events will be documented in later phases
}
</script>
```

### Phase 1 Completion Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 2:

1. [ ] All components have clear, concise descriptions
2. [ ] Component purposes and responsibilities are well documented
3. [ ] Documentation follows no-prefix rule
4. [ ] Documentation focuses on component-level concerns
5. [ ] Documentation explains component roles in the application
6. [ ] Documentation helps new developers understand the system

Remember:
- Focus only on component-level documentation in this phase
- Props, events, and methods will be documented in later phases
- Get approval before proceeding to Phase 2 (Method Documentation)
