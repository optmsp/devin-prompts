# Vue.js Documentation Process Overview

> **Note to Developers**: This is a guide for you to understand the documentation process. To actually document your code, you will need to copy and paste the specific playbook files (mentioned below) to Devin at each phase of the process.

This guide provides developers with a high-level overview of the phased approach to documenting Vue.js code. It outlines the process that will occur when using Devin to document your Vue.js codebase. The documentation process is divided into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview

The documentation process is broken down into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Component Documentation**
   - Focus on component-level documentation
   - Document overall purpose and responsibilities
   - Refer to `vuejs-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for implementation

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document component methods and lifecycle hooks
   - Include parameter and return types
   - Refer to `vuejs-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for implementation

3. **Phase 3: Props and Events Documentation**
   - Document component props and events
   - Include type information and validation rules
   - Refer to `vuejs-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for implementation

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target Vue.js project folder
- Knowledge of Vue.js documentation standards (refer to "Vue.js Code Documentation KB")
- Vue.js DevTools for component inspection (if available)
- TypeScript configuration (if used)


### Process Flow
1. Copy the Phase 1 playbook (`vuejs-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md`) to Devin
2. Devin will document components and request your approval
3. Copy the Phase 2 playbook (`vuejs-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md`) to Devin
4. Devin will document methods and request your approval
5. Copy the Phase 3 playbook (`vuejs-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md`) to Devin
6. Devin will document props/events and request your final approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before proceeding to the next
- Devin will follow the Vue.js Code Documentation KB guidelines
- Devin will use TypeScript for type validation when available
- Documentation will focus on clarity and maintainability

### Implementation Steps
To begin documentation with Devin, copy and paste the following playbooks in sequence:
1. Phase 1 (Components): Copy `vuejs-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` to Devin
2. Phase 2 (Methods): Copy `vuejs-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` to Devin after Phase 1 approval
3. Phase 3 (Props/Events): Copy `vuejs-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` to Devin after Phase 2 approval
