Hi Devin! This playbook will guide you through documenting Python code using a phased approach. The documentation process is split into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview
The documentation process is divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Module and Class Documentation**
   - Focus on high-level module and class descriptions
   - Document overall purpose and role in the system
   - See: `python-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document method signatures, behaviors, and parameters
   - Include return types and exceptions
   - See: `python-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Phase 3: Variable Documentation**
   - Document module/class attributes and constants
   - Include type hints and constraints
   - See: `python-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for detailed instructions

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target Python project folder
- Knowledge of Python documentation standards (refer to "Python Code Documentation KB")
- Understanding of PEP 257 and PEP 484
- Doctest and mypy for validation (if available in the project)

### Process Flow
1. Start with Phase 1 (Modules/Classes)
2. Get approval after completing Phase 1
3. Move to Phase 2 (Methods)
4. Get approval after completing Phase 2
5. Complete Phase 3 (Variables)
6. Final review and approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before moving to the next
- Follow the detailed instructions in the phase-specific playbooks
- Refer to the Python Documentation KB for standards and best practices
- Use doctest and mypy validation throughout the process
- Focus on clarity and maintainability
- Follow PEP 257 docstring conventions
