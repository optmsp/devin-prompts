Hi Devin! This playbook provides a high-level overview of the phased approach to documenting Python code. The documentation process is divided into three distinct phases to ensure thorough and organized documentation.

### Overview

The documentation process is broken down into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Module and Class Documentation**
   - Focus on module and class-level documentation
   - Document overall purpose and responsibilities
   - Refer to `python-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md` for implementation

2. **Phase 2: Method Documentation**
   - Document method signatures and behaviors
   - Include parameter and return types
   - Refer to `python-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md` for implementation

3. **Phase 3: Variable Documentation**
   - Document module/class attributes and variables
   - Include type hints and constraints
   - Refer to `python-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md` for implementation

### Prerequisites
- Access to the target Python project folder
- Knowledge of Python documentation standards (refer to "Python Code Documentation KB")
- Understanding of PEP 257 and PEP 484
- Mypy or similar type checker (if available)

### Process Flow
1. Begin with Phase 1 (Module/Class Documentation)
2. Request user approval of Phase 1 documentation
3. Proceed to Phase 2 (Method Documentation)
4. Request user approval of Phase 2 documentation
5. Complete Phase 3 (Variable Documentation)
6. Request final user approval

### Important Notes
- Each phase must be completed and approved before proceeding
- Follow the Python Code Documentation KB guidelines
- Use mypy for type hint validation when available
- Focus on clarity and maintainability

For detailed implementation steps, refer to the phase-specific playbooks:
- Phase 1: `python-doc-step1-classes-playbook.md`
- Phase 2: `python-doc-step2-methods-playbook.md`
- Phase 3: `python-doc-step3-variables-playbook.md`
